An introduction to a series on binary exploitation using
<span class="text-[#FF5F00]">Rust</span>, covering history, concepts,
techniques and mitigations, with challenges to complete. This series uses the
Linux and Windows NT kernels as references, on Intel and AMD architectures, but
also the *nix[^1] family and the ARM architecture will be used as examples.
It is also assumed that you have a basic knowledge of programming logic and
operating systems.

I used Rust as the language for the codes in this series to better understand
the language and use a more modern language than C and C++, with robust
standards, conventions and good practices. Heavily inspired by
[Rust for Malware Development](https://envs.sh/2wi).

My binary exploitation studies began in 2021, and in 2025 I decided to start
this series to test and share my knowledge.

[^1]: "**\*nix**" refer to Unix-like kernels or operating systems.

### Table of Contents

### Definition

By definition, binary exploitation is the exploration of vulnerabilities in
programs or processes to develop techniques to exploit, consequently,
mitigations are developed to counter these techniques.

Binary exploitation is a fundamental area in other areas, but it does not mean
that it is the same as other areas, for example, web exploitation deals with
protocols, technologies and tools within the web, even if it uses binary
exploitation, it is classified as web exploitation.

There are some exceptions, for example, exploiting V8, Google's JavaScript and
WebAssembly engine, which is used in the web context, is not necessarily a web
exploitation, as V8 is used in other contexts, such as interpreters, so it can
be considered a binary exploitation.

### History

Fundamental vulnerabilities such as **Buffer Overflow** were already documented
in papers such as "**Computer Security Technology Planning Study**" (1972), and
papers such as "**The Protection of Information in Computer Systems**" (1975)
introduced security information, including memory access and isolation between
processes.

One of the first websites about binary exploitation is
[Phrack](https://phrack.org/), a site where anyone can submit an e-zine
about hacking. The first articles addressing binary exploitation are:
“**[Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit](https://phrack.org/issues/49/14)**”
(1996), “**[File Descriptor Hijacking](https://phrack.org/issues/51/5)**”
(1997) and “**[Frame Pointer Overwriting](https://phrack.org/issues/55/8)**”
(1999).

In addition to the articles, mitigations for binary exploitation were
introduced in the 1990s, such as **Stack Smashing Protection (Stack Canary)**
and **Executable Space Protection (NX Bit)**, currently combined with other
mitigations. There are also mitigations like **Write Xor Execute (W^X)**, that
I'll cover in the next parts.

Due to the creation and removal of various codes, articles, and websites
throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, it is difficult to determine the
earliest examples of vulnerabilities and mitigations that ever existed.

#### CVE and CWE

In 1999, the MITRE Corporation released a standard for reporting and
tracking vulnerabilities in libraries, services, and products, called
**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**, which at its release
already contained 321 records.

Then after the creation of CVE, 7 years passed, and in 2006 a standard was also
released to categorize and classify vulnerabilities registered in CVE, called
**Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**.

At the moment, there are over 240,000 CVE records, and various historical
events were recorded, crafting new types of exploitations. Below is a list of
some historical events related to binary exploitation:

- [CVE-2024-38063](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38063)
    (Windows TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability)
- [CVE-2021-34527](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34527)
    (PrintNightmare)
- [CVE-2019-0708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-0708)
    (BlueKeep)
- [CVE-2017-5754](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-5754)
    (Meltdown)
- [CVE-2017-5753](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-5753)
    (Spectre)
- [CVE-2017-0144](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-0144)
    (EternalBlue)
- [CVE-2014-6271](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-6271)
    (Shellshock)
- [CVE-2014-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160)
    (Heartbleed)

### Conclusion

This first part only introduces the context of binary exploitation, from the
other parts onwards, we will see examples of vulnerabilities and mitigations
within that context.

The next part will be about **Executable File**, and the two famous formats in
Linux and Windows, and **Memory Layout**, in Intel and AMD architectures.
