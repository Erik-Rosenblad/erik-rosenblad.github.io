description: An introduction to a series on binary exploitation using Rust.
---

An introduction to a series on binary exploitation using
<span class="text-[#FF7843]">Rust</span>, covering history, concepts,
techniques and mitigations, with challenges to complete. This series uses the
Linux and Windows NT kernels as references, on Intel and AMD architectures, but
also the *nix[^1] family and the ARM architecture will be used as examples.
It is also assumed that you have a basic knowledge of programming logic and
operating systems.

I used Rust as the language for the codes in this series to better understand
the language and use a more modern language than C and C++, with robust
standards, conventions and good practices. Heavily inspired by
[Rust for Malware Development](https://envs.sh/2wi).

My binary exploitation studies began in 2021, and in 2025 I decided to start
this series to test and share my knowledge.

[^1]: "**\*nix**" refer to Unix-like kernels or operating systems.

### Table of Contents

### Definition

By definition, binary exploitation is the exploration of vulnerabilities in
programs or processes to develop techniques to exploit, consequently,
mitigations are developed to counter these techniques.

Binary exploitation is a fundamental area in other areas, but it does not mean
that it is the same as other areas, for example, web exploitation deals with
protocols, technologies and tools within the web, even if it uses binary
exploitation, it is classified as web exploitation.

There are some exceptions, for example, exploiting the V8, Google's JavaScript
and WebAssembly engine, which is used in the web context, is not necessarily a
web exploitation, as V8 is used in other contexts, such as interpreters, so it
can be considered a binary exploitation.

### Procedure

The procedure for binary exploitation involves analyzing and fuzzing a program
or process, whether it is an application, driver or kernel to identify any
vulnerabilities.

There are 2 types of analysis: **Static Program Analysis** and **Dynamic
Program Analysis**. Static program analysis interprets the program, while
dynamic program analysis interprets the process. There are various techniques
to make program analysis more difficult, and the most known techniques are
**Obfuscation** and **Virtualization**. Obfuscation is the transformation
of compiled code or source code into a more complex code. Virtualization is the
execution of unknown or obfuscated instructions.

Fuzzing is a subset of analysis that uses the available information of program
to test the program's inputs. Fuzzers are generally used to perform tests
automatically, and there are various techniques that can be performed, but they
can be divided into 3 main concepts:

- **Black-Box:** Based on knowledge of program inputs only.
- **White-Box:** Based on knowledge of program code, including the inputs.
- **Grey-Box:** A middle ground based knowledge between black box and grey box.

To learn more about analysis, see:
"**[Static Program Analysis: Its Usage And Limits](https://envs.sh/2qq)**"
and
"**[Dynamic program analysis of Microsoft Windows](https://envs.sh/2q0)**".

### History

Fundamental vulnerabilities, such as **Buffer Overflow**, have existed since
the early days of computing, documented in the article "**Computer Security
Technology Planning Study"** from 1972. Additionally, articles like **"The
Protection of Information in Computer Systems"** from 1975 introduced security
information conceps, including memory access and isolation between processes.

One of the first websites about binary exploitation is
[Phrack](https://phrack.org/), a site where anyone can submit an e-zine
about hacking. The first articles addressing binary exploitation were:
“**[Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit](https://phrack.org/issues/49/14)**”
from 1996, “**[File Descriptor Hijacking](https://phrack.org/issues/51/5)**”
from 1997 and “**[Frame Pointer Overwriting](https://phrack.org/issues/55/8)**”
from 1999.

In addition to the articles, mitigations for binary exploitation were
introduced in the 1990s, such as **Stack Smashing Protection (Stack Canary)**
builtin into the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), and **Executable Space
Protection (NX Bit)** first introduced in the **x86-64** architecture. There
are also mitigations like **Write Xor Execute (W^X)**, that I'll cover in the
next parts.

Due to the creation and removal of various codes, articles, and websites
throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, it is difficult to determine the
earliest examples of vulnerabilities and mitigations that ever existed.

#### CVE and CWE

In 1999, the MITRE Corporation released a standard for reporting and
tracking vulnerabilities in libraries, services, and applications, called
**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**, which at its release
already contained 321 records. At the moment, there are over 240,000 CVE
records.

Binary exploitation is a well-known area in CVEs, by the fact that most of
the records are from applications or libraries rather than web services, for
example. There were various historical CVEs, and various of them were related
to binary exploitation, for reasons such as the kernel being within the binary
exploit area. Some of them are listed below:

- [CVE-2024-38063](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38063)
    (Windows TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability)
- [CVE-2021-34527](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34527)
    (PrintNightmare)
- [CVE-2019-0708](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-0708)
    (BlueKeep)
- [CVE-2017-5754](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-5754)
    (Meltdown)
- [CVE-2017-5753](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-5753)
    (Spectre)
- [CVE-2017-0144](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-0144)
    (EternalBlue)
- [CVE-2014-6271](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-6271)
    (Shellshock)
- [CVE-2014-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0160)
    (Heartbleed)

After the creation of CVE, 7 years passed, and in 2006 a standard was also
released to classify and categorize vulnerabilities registered in CVE, called
**Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**, which various of them are related to
binary exploitation. Some of the classifications are:

- **CWE-20:** Improper Input Validation.
- **CWE-94:** Improper Control of Generation of Code.
- **CWE-115:** Misinterpretation of Input.
- **CWE-120:** Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input.

### Conclusion

This first part only introduces the context of binary exploitation, from the
other parts onwards, we will see examples of vulnerabilities and mitigations
within that context.

The next part will be about **Executable File**, and the two famous formats in
Linux and Windows, and **Memory Layout**, in Intel and AMD architectures.
